## Key Elements of Wireframing

Wireframes include several key elements that help designers and developers plan the structure and functionality of a system:

1. **Layout Structure**  
   - Defines the arrangement of different sections on a page (header, footer, main content, sidebars).  
   - **Example:** A booking website may have a search bar at the top, a list of properties in the main area, and filters on the side for easy navigation.

2. **Navigation**  
   - Shows how users will move through the application or website.  
   - **Example:** A top navigation menu for Home, Listings, Profile, and Checkout pages helps users access key sections quickly.

3. **Content Placement**  
   - Determines where text, images, buttons, and other elements are positioned.  
   - **Example:** In a property listing, the property image is on the left, description on the right, and the "Book Now" button is clearly visible.

4. **Functionality**  
   - Illustrates interactive elements and how users can perform actions.  
   - **Example:** Buttons, dropdowns, and search fields in a booking system show what actions users can take, like filtering properties or submitting a booking.

These elements collectively ensure the wireframe communicates the intended structure and user experience clearly, even before visual design begins.
## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes can be categorized into **low-fidelity** and **high-fidelity**, depending on their level of detail and purpose:

1. **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**  
   - Simple, basic sketches or digital layouts.  
   - Focus on structure, layout, and functionality rather than visual design.  
   - **Use Case:** Early stages of design when brainstorming and validating ideas quickly.  
   - **Example:** A rough sketch showing where the header, navigation, content sections, and buttons will be placed.

2. **High-Fidelity Wireframes**  
   - Detailed and closer to the final design.  
   - Include precise spacing, content, images, and sometimes basic interactions.  
   - **Use Case:** Later stages of design when visual hierarchy and usability need testing before prototyping.  
   - **Example:** A digital wireframe in Figma showing actual text, icons, buttons, and approximate styling.

### Identifying the Wireframe Type

The type of wireframe depends on its **purpose and level of detail**:

- If the wireframe is **rough, quick, and focuses on layout and flow**, it is **low-fidelity**.  
- If it is **detailed, includes realistic content, and resembles the final product**, it is **high-fidelity**.
