## Key Elements of Wireframing

Wireframes include several key elements that help designers and developers plan the structure and functionality of a system:

1. **Layout Structure**  
   - Defines the arrangement of different sections on a page (header, footer, main content, sidebars).  
   - **Example:** A booking website may have a search bar at the top, a list of properties in the main area, and filters on the side for easy navigation.

2. **Navigation**  
   - Shows how users will move through the application or website.  
   - **Example:** A top navigation menu for Home, Listings, Profile, and Checkout pages helps users access key sections quickly.

3. **Content Placement**  
   - Determines where text, images, buttons, and other elements are positioned.  
   - **Example:** In a property listing, the property image is on the left, description on the right, and the "Book Now" button is clearly visible.

4. **Functionality**  
   - Illustrates interactive elements and how users can perform actions.  
   - **Example:** Buttons, dropdowns, and search fields in a booking system show what actions users can take, like filtering properties or submitting a booking.

These elements collectively ensure the wireframe communicates the intended structure and user experience clearly, even before visual design begins.
